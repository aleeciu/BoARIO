The source-code is available at the GitHub repo: https://github.com/spjuhel/BoARIO

At the moment there is not a BoARIO python package. But this will come once I take a look into it !

Requirements
===============

BoARIO is currently developed using python ``3.8``.

An ``environment.yml`` file should list all python packages required to run the model.
Creating an environment with :

.. code-block:: console

   conda env create -f environment.yml

should create an ``ario3`` the correct conda environment.

If you are experiencing difficulties in setting up a working environment feel free to `open an issue`_ on the github repository or to `contact the developer`_
